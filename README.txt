Calendar Utility

Description/ How to use:
This calendar utility allows the user to save events that they can later view on a calendar interface that is comprised of both monthly and daily view screens. Each event contains a title, description, start date and time, and end time. The user can also add an optional color label to the event. These events can be edited and deleted. 

The daily calendar view will automatically open to the current day. 
The user can move to the next or previous day using buttons at the bottom of the screen. To switch to monthly view, the user can select the button in the upper-left corner.

Within monthly view, the user can switch the current month and year by using the dropdown menus on the top of the screen. To go to daily view, they can either select the button on the upper left or click on the specific day that they want to visit.

Events can be added by clicking on the button in the upper-right corner on either daily or monthly view. All events scheduled for a given day will appear on that day's corresponding daily view screen. By hovering over an event the user can see the inputted description. By clicking on the event they can edit or delete it. The first four events will also appear on that day's square in monthly view, and the first two events will be visible in the yesterday and tomorrow buttons on the bottom screen of its neighboring days.

In addition to scheduled events, the user can also add items that do not correspond to a specific time to a to-do list that is displayed on the right side of daily view screens. These will be consistent from day to day, and will stay on the list until they are removed by clicking the checkbox.

How to open:
Set the inner directory labeled calendar as the source file (if not automatic). Run the file CalendarTestDrive (calendar/src/Sample) to execute.
You may have to add .ser to your compiler resources.
